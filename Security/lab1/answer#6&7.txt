answer to questions #7 and #7:
6) In the affine cipher (a*p+b), how many unique keys exist for a given alphabet?

Answer is 312, because a and 26 are needs to be coprimes, so in mod 26 there  are only 12 numbers can be as a, and b out of 26 letters, so 12*26 = 312 uniqie keys exists.

7)In the transposition cipher, the obvious weak point is the way the message is padded to length. How would you handle this weakness?

This weakness can be solved by making padding undefinable, for example using different symbols for padding, by using not rarely using symbols such that X, Z etc.
Transposition cipher is very easy to break, but this cipher can be  strengthen by using double transposition, f.e. a columnar transposition applied twice, the same key can be used for both transpositions, or two different keys. 
    Also combination of two ciphers will strengthen, f.e. by taking a rotating substitution cipher, and doing  transpositions both before and after the substitution.
