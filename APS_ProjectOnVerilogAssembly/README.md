Project "Single-cycle CPU design"

1.Basic CPU design
  Design of  a simple 32-bit processor connected to a separate instruction and data memory.
2.Code with RISC-V assembly language
  Writing bubble sort with assembly language;
3. Run assembly code on build CPU
  Translating program (Bubble sort) from the RISC-V assembly language into the machine code of build up CPU design.
